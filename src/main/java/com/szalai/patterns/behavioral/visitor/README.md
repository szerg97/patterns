## Problem

You build an application where there are nodes and stuff, the whole
software is already in production, so you don't want to risk it to have
a potential bug source when you add new code to the project. Your new
task is to create a component that exports the data in XML format. Later,
it can happen that the customer will need a new export format, other
than XML.

## Solution

The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a 
separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into 
existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior 
is now passed to one of the visitorâ€™s methods as an argument, providing
the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.
